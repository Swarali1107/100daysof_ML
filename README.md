# Canada Per Capita Income Prediction using Linear Regression

This project explores the foundational concepts of Linear Regression and applies them to predict Canada's per capita income over time. The goal is to implement a basic machine learning model from scratch and understand how regression, gradient descent, and data preprocessing techniques work in practice.

## 🔍 Objective

To predict per capita income in Canada based on historical data using:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multivariate Regression
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Dummy Variables & One-Hot Encoding (for extended examples)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is a simple CSV file containing:
- `year`: Calendar year
- `per capita income (US$)`: Recorded income

> Source: Manually prepared or publicly available sample data

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Linear Regression (Single and Multiple Variables)
- Cost Function & Mean Squared Error
- Gradient Descent Algorithm
- Categorical Feature Encoding:
  - Dummy Variables
  - One-Hot Encoding
